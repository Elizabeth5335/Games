# Games

Gamesss is a project for practicing the use of JavaScript.

It is a website with three games. It was written using HTML, CSS and a looooot of JavaScript. 

Initially, the website was supposed to be only for desktops. However in the end I decided to make it mobile friendly as well :)                                  

It was hosted on GitHub Pages: https://elizabeth5335.github.io/Games/index.html
